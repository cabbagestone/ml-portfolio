# Python Page Rank implementation

## Project Goal

use data concepts learned from research to implement a page rank algorithm. Given a list of search terms, return a list of pages sorted by relevancy.

## outline:

### Continuously (?)
- get the pages
  - Crawl the internet and follow links
  - have some sort of limiter
  - have a starting place based on the search term?
- create an index of the pages

### On search
- parse the indexes
- create the graph
- sort the graph using pagerank
- return the results
